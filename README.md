# Terminal Workshop by GDSC

Welcome to the Terminal Workshop hosted by Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) and led by Krish Jain!

## About the Workshop

This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the power and versatility of the terminal. You'll learn essential command-line skills that will boost your productivity as a developer.

## Presentation Method

We'll be using Google's `present` tool, a powerful utility written in Go, to deliver this workshop. The `present` tool allows for an interactive and engaging presentation directly in the terminal.

### What is `present`?

`present` is a command-line tool that:
- Renders and displays slide presentations
- Supports live code execution during presentations
- Allows for easy navigation between slides using keyboard shortcuts

This approach provides a unique, hands-on experience that aligns perfectly with our terminal-focused workshop.
